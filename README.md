## What is Hibiscus?

## Contributing

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have the following things

* [AutoHotkey Current](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (not V2)
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)
* [`pahket`](https://github.com/NickSeagull/pahket/releases) - Make sure the `.exe` is in [your `PATH`](https://dev.to/bsoyka/adding-files-to-the-path-on-windows-10-39jo)

1. Clone this repo somewhere safe:
   ```ps
   cd C:\Users\yourname\some\safe\folder
   git clone https://github.com/NickSeagull/hibiscus
   ```
2. Create a folder called `Hibiscus` in your _My Documents_ folder.
3. Inside of the `Hibiscus` folder you've just created, create an `init.ahk` file. This is where you will write your automation code.
4. Go to the folder where you've cloned this repo to, using the file explorer.
5. Open `hibiscus.ahk`
6. Additionally, if you want Hibiscus to run when you log into Windows, create a shortcut to `hibiscus.ahk` in the `shell:startup` folder (you can access this folder by typing `shell:startup` into the address bar of the file explorer)

## Updating Hibiscus

For now, Hibiscus doesn't have an auto-update feature, to update it, perform a `git pull` in the folder you've cloned it:

```ps
cd C:\Users\yourname\some\safe\folder\hibiscus
git pull
```
